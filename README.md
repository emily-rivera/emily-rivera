# Hey! I'm so glad you're here!

I'm [Emily](https://emily-rivera.tech/), a **web designer** & **full-stack developer** based in **Salt Lake City, UT**.

When I'm not finagling with flexbox or battling recursive functions, you can probably find me:

- 🎵 Rollerskating to my favorite songs
- 🕹️ Fighting monsters or solving puzzles in a video game
- 🏕️ Camping with my husband & dogs
- 🎨 Crafting something special

I enjoy using the following technologies to develop cool things:
